                    has suffiecient time to attend to the present needs he/she has on a daily basis and this makes other <br> 
                    non-physically present needs suffer. The goal tracker app was created in such a such a simple user <br>
                    interface that any person learned enough to own a smart phone or generally, an electronic gadget can <br>
                    use it with ease. <br>
                    It possesses a sign in page that collects the user information and stores it so the user would be recognised<br>
                    at a later date. it also has a dashboard where the user can see his/her details about the goals he/she has <br>
                    created. The dashboard also has the option to create a new goal. <br>
                    In order to achieve utmost satisfaction from the app, users are enjoined to check the app at least once <br>

                    that they have reached on the current task. <br>
                    The app was created as a task given to a team of hardworking software engineers who are remote interns at <br>
                    Hotels.NG. They pulled ideas together and came up with the most creative, user-friendly way to deliver the <br>
                    to the users. <br>
